# cs-problem-collection

This is an ongoing collection of my notes for problem solving exercises, handwritten using a notetaking app on the iPad, Notability.

My solutions are far from perfect, but through this project, I've found that thoroughly documenting my thought process has helped to refine my method of tackling problems. Especially since I'm writing these rather than typing! The point of these is not to get to a solution as fast as possible, but to take my time and allow myself to struggle through puzzles I haven't had more exposure to. In doing so, I solidify my computer science fundamentals - data structures, algorithms, and discrete math.

I try to document the following elements:
1. Diagrams of input / expected output - having a visual of the problem to start off with is super helpful
2. My initial thoughts - Do I immediately use intuition? Is brute force the first thing that comes to mind? Have I seen a problem similar to this one before?
3. Try to manually solve the problem to solidify my understanding of it
4. Write out the solution in a recipe-like format before jumping to code
5. If I'm confident with step 4, proceed to write the solution in JavaScript/pseudocode as if I'm writing on a whiteboard
6. Test the solution by using a step-by-step "debugging" process, with diagrams if needed
7. Analyze time and space complexity

Depending on the problem, not every step above is covered in my notes, but I try to keep them in mind!
